# java_book_object 
A Java program written to mimic the functionality of a Python program on my profile, [found here](https://github.com/CallumOB/book_object).

The main aim of the program can be found on the other repository, but the main parts are demonstrating:
- Inheritance 
- Abstraction 
- An alternative to operator overloading present in the Python program
- Taking user input and error checking

This is a very basic program but demonstrates a few very important OOP concepts.
